(ns kotobase.gremlin.traversal
  "gremlin.kotobase.net -- a v0.1 Apache TinkerPop (tinkerpop.apache.org)
  Gremlin traversal subset over kotobase, via the shared
  `kotobase.query.bridge` (ADR-2607172300 in `com-junkawasaki/root`,
  ADR-2607172500 scoping this repo).

  Pure `.cljc` -- **zero socket/GraphSON-framing concepts in this
  namespace**, same separation-of-concerns discipline `org-ietf-sftp`
  (`kotobase.sftp.fs` vs `kotobase.sftp.transport.*`) and
  `org-postgresql-wire` use between core query-translation logic and
  transport. The `.cljs`-only WebSocket + GraphSON wire layer that calls
  into `execute` below lives in `kotobase.gremlin.wire`.

  ## Bytecode-shaped input, not raw Gremlin script text (deliberate v0.1
  scope reduction, ADR-2607172500)

  This namespace does **not** parse Groovy-shaped Gremlin script strings
  (`g.V().hasLabel('users').values('name')` as source text) -- it accepts a
  small EDN vector-of-steps \"bytecode\" that is structurally close to how
  real TinkerPop Bytecode is shaped (a flat list of `[step-name & args]`
  instructions), just simplified to plain EDN instead of TinkerPop's
  GraphSON-typed Bytecode object graph:

  ```clojure
  [[:V] [:hasLabel \"users\"] [:has \"role\" \"admin\"] [:values \"name\"]]
  ```

  is the bytecode-shaped equivalent of the Gremlin traversal
  `g.V().hasLabel('users').has('role', 'admin').values('name')`. Avoiding a
  Groovy-subset parser on top of everything else this repo already does
  (translation + a real WebSocket transport) is an honest, deliberate v0.1
  scope boundary -- see the References section below and this repo's
  README for exactly what is and is not supported.

  ## v0.1 traversal-step subset (hard scope boundary)

  | Step | Bytecode shape | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|
  | `g.V()` | `[:V]` | scan a materialized vertex collection -- MUST be the first step |
  | `.hasLabel(label)` | `[:hasLabel label]` | filter: current vertex's `:kotobase/coll` (materialized collection name) equals `label` |
  | `.has(prop, value)` | `[:has prop value]` | filter: current vertex's `prop` attribute equals `value` (equality only) |
  | `.out(edgeLabel)` | `[:out edgeLabel]` | outgoing edge traversal -- see \"Edge convention\" below |
  | `.in(edgeLabel)` | `[:in edgeLabel]` | incoming edge traversal -- see \"Edge convention\" below |
  | `.values(prop)` | `[:values prop]` | projection, TERMINAL step -- MUST be the last step, produces the result list |

  **Explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for v0.1** (rejected with a clear error by
  `execute`/`translate`, never silently ignored or partially executed):
  full Gremlin script `eval` (arbitrary Groovy-shaped expressions --
  n/a here since input is already bytecode-shaped, not script text, but
  worth stating for anyone porting a real GraphSON `\"op\": \"eval\"`
  request into this namespace: it is not supported, only `\"op\":
  \"bytecode\"` is, see `kotobase.gremlin.wire`), `.repeat()`/variable-length
  paths, lambda/closure steps, mutation steps (`addV`/`addE`/`drop`/`property`
  writes), transactions, `.hasLabel`/`.values` with more than one argument
  (real Gremlin's multi-key `.values(k1, k2)` has flat multi-key fan-out
  stream semantics that would change this translator's single-`?var`-per-
  step shape -- out of scope, rejected explicitly), `.hasLabel`/`.has` OR
  semantics (`.hasLabel(l1, l2)`), any step name not in the table above.

  ## Vertex collections MUST be declared explicitly by the caller

  Unlike `org-opencypher-cypher`'s Cypher translator (where every node
  pattern is labeled on both ends of a relationship,
  `(a:LabelA)-[:REL]->(b:LabelB)`, so the set of collections to materialize
  is mechanically derivable from the parsed statement), a Gremlin
  `.out(edgeLabel)`/`.in(edgeLabel)` step does NOT self-declare the target
  vertex's label -- `g.V().hasLabel('users').out('worksAt').values('name')`
  never names the `departments` collection in the traversal at all. This
  namespace therefore requires the CALLER to declare, up front, every
  `kotobase.store` collection that should be materialized as vertices --
  the `:vertex-colls` key in `execute`'s `ctx` map, a seq of collection
  identifiers exactly like `kotobase.query.bridge/materialize`'s own
  `coll-keys` argument (which this namespace passes it straight through to).
  This is this repo's own, deliberate v0.1 convention (documented here, not
  silently assumed) -- the deploy shell / test fixtures that own the graph
  schema are expected to supply the full vertex-collection set, the same
  \"deploy shell provides the schema\" discipline ADR-2607172500 uses for
  `org-graphql-http`'s SDL.

  ## Edge convention: reference-valued attribute -> target `:kotobase/key`

  There is no first-class \"edge\" concept in kotobase's flat document
  model (`kotobase.store` is get/put/list per collection, nothing else) --
  same starting point `org-opencypher-cypher`'s relationship-pattern bonus
  scope documents for itself. This repo's own convention, applied
  mechanically: a materialized vertex represents an outgoing edge labeled
  `edgeLabel` by carrying an attribute named `(keyword edgeLabel)` whose
  value equals the TARGET vertex's `:kotobase/key` (a STRING, per
  `kotobase.query.bridge`'s own doc->datoms mapping -- materialized keys are
  always strings). Concretely, for `.out(\"worksAt\")` starting from a
  `users` vertex to reach a `departments` vertex, the `users` document must
  carry `{:worksAt \"d1\" ...}` where `\"d1\"` is the target department's
  key. `.in(\"worksAt\")` is the exact reverse traversal (find every vertex
  whose `:worksAt` attribute equals the CURRENT vertex's `:kotobase/key`) --
  it does not require a separately-stored 'incoming edge' list, it is a
  Datalog join run in the opposite direction over the SAME stored
  attribute. This is exactly the `fk-attr` convention
  `kotobase.protocols.cypher`'s relationship-pattern bonus scope uses,
  applied via `edgeLabel` directly (Gremlin edge labels have no
  Cypher-style `SNAKE_CASE` -> lower-case folding rule to mirror -- the
  label string is used verbatim as the attribute name, via `keyword`).

  ## Result semantics -- deduplicated set, not a Gremlin bag

  Real Gremlin traversals have *bag* (multiset) semantics -- `.values()`
  can and does emit duplicate values for duplicate matching paths.
  `kotobase.query.bridge/q` (and the `arrangement.datalog` engine
  underneath it) returns a mathematical SET of result tuples -- this
  namespace inherits that dedup behavior unchanged rather than
  reimplementing bag semantics on top, and documents it here as an honest
  v0.1 simplification (same simplification `org-opencypher-cypher`
  documents for its own `execute`, which also delegates straight to the
  bridge). `execute` sorts the (already-deduplicated) results by
  stringified value for deterministic output across runs -- there is no
  `.order()` step in v0.1, this is an implementation convenience only, not
  a Gremlin ordering guarantee.

  ## `visible?` -- required, injectable, never defaulted

  `ctx` passed to `execute` MUST include `:visible?`, a predicate over
  materialized datoms (`(fn [{:keys [s p o]}] boolean?)`) -- the same
  discipline `kotobase.query.bridge`/`arrangement.datalog`/
  `kotobase.protocols.cypher` enforce (ADR-2607050500, \"Query as
  first-class effect\"). `execute` throws immediately (a ctx-construction
  bug, not a traversal error) if `:visible?` is missing -- there is no
  silent `(constantly true)` fallback anywhere in this namespace.

  to have a notion of order and of a row window, which it does not.

  `.order()` is bare — TinkerPop's `.by()` modulators (`.order().by('age',
  desc)`) are out of scope, and `.order()` with no `.by()` is natural
  ascending in TinkerPop too, so the bare form means what it means there.

  `.dedup()` is accepted and is a NO-OP on this backend: the bridge's Datalog
  `q` already has set semantics, so results arrive distinct. It is kept
  because a Gremlin user writes it habitually and erroring would be hostile,
  and it is documented as a no-op because claiming it collapses something
  would misplace where the collapse happens."
